# Uninstalling Unlaunch

::: danger

Installing or uninstalling Unlaunch, while safe, writes to the console's NAND, so there's a small chance to brick your console!

:::

**WARNING:** While uninstalling Unlaunch is relatively safe, there is still a small chance of bricking your Nintendo DSi. Here are some cases on why you may want to uninstall Unlaunch but with solutions that don't require uninstalling.

- **I don't want to use a custom menu anymore and I don't like having the Unlaunch file menu show on boot:** You can follow the [Unlaunch post install steps](installing-unlaunch.html#section-iii-post-unlaunch-configuration) to have Unlaunch autoboot the DSi menu
- **The Unlaunch Background is scary:** [Reinstall Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) by selecting one of the available custom backgrounds
- **I'm having an issue with Unlaunch or my console after installing it:** The [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html#unlaunch) page will explain how to fix many issues you may have

::: warning

To reduce the chances of bricking, make sure that you have not installed any illegitimate DSiWare to your NAND backup (the SDNAND redirection provided by hiyaCFW does not count), or have otherwise tampered with system files.

:::

Once you have reviewed the above information, follow the [Dumping NAND](installing-unlaunch.html) instructions up to the uninstall part.
