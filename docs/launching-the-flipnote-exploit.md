title: Launching the Exploit (Flipnote Lenny)
---

We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For the best Unlaunch-free experience, we recommend using an exploit called "Flipnote Lenny" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the Flipnote Studio application handles flipnotes.

Launching the exploit will boot you into TWiLight Menu++, a homebrew application that acts as a replacement to the DSi Menu.

## Requirements
- A way to copy downloaded files to your SD card
- An application that can extract archives, such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Windows) or [The Unarchiver](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353) (macOS)
   - We advise you to not use WinRAR, as it is known to break things
- Flipnote Studio installed on your Nintendo DSi
   - If you do not have Flipnote Studio, then go to the previous page and use Memory Pit instead

## Section I - SD card setup
::: warning

Ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup).

::: tip

### Checking your System Version

### Flipnote Lenny
1. Download the latest version of [Flipnote Lenny](https://davejmurphy.com/%CD%A1-%CD%9C%CA%96-%CD%A1/)

::: tip

Unsure what the SD "root" is? [See this image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/489307733074640926/756947922804932739/wherestheroot.png)

1. Extract the `_nds` folder from `TWiLightMenu-DSi.7z` to the root of your SD card

## Section II - Launching the exploit
1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Flipnote Studio application
1. Open the Flipnote Studio settings on the top-right of the main menu and ensure that `Start on Calendar` is disabled and `Frog` is enabled
1. View the flipnotes stored on the SD card
1. Tap on the face corresponding to your region
   - If you have an AUS console, select EUR
1. Edit the selected flipnote
1. Tap the frog icon on the bottom-left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select `Copy` -> `Back` -> `Exit`
1. Tap on the second note with a larger face, and select `Edit`
1. Tap on the frog icon on the bottom-left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select paste

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have TWiLight Menu++'s `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card. Follow the [TWiLight Menu++ setup guide](launching-the-exploit.html#twilight-menu) again.

:::

You should now see the TWiLight Menu++ language selection.

## Section III - Configuring TWiLight Menu++
1. When prompted, set your preferred language and region
1. Once you're in TWiLight Menu++, press SELECT to switch to the DS Classic Menu
1. Tap the DS icon in the bottom middle to open settings
1. Use the <kbd class="l">L</kbd> / <kbd class="r">R</kbd> or <kbd class="face">X</kbd> / <kbd class="face">Y</kbd> buttons to switch over to the "Misc. settings" page
1. Switch the "SysNAND Region" entry to your console's region
1. Press <kbd class="face">B</kbd> to save and exit TWiLight Menu++ settings

You are now able to use TWiLight Menu++, however it's recommended to continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.

::: tip

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand)
