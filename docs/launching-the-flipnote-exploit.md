# Launching the Exploit (Flipnote Lenny)

We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For the best Unlaunch-free experience, we recommend using an exploit called "Flipnote Lenny" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the Flipnote Studio application handles flipnotes.


## Requirements

- Flipnote Studio installed on your Nintendo DSi
    - If you do not have Flipnote Studio, then use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit.html) instead


## Section I - SD card setup

1. Download the latest version of [Flipnote Lenny](https://davejmurphy.com/%CD%A1-%CD%9C%CA%96-%CD%A1/)
1. Copy the `private` folder from the Flipnote Lenny archive to the root of your SD card


## Section II - Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Flipnote Studio application
    - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
1. Open the Flipnote Studio settings on the top-right of the main menu and ensure that `Start on Calendar` is disabled and `Frog` is enabled
1. View the flipnotes stored on the SD card
    - If you are unable to view the flipnotes on the SD card, please use another SD card
1. Tap on the face corresponding to your region
    - If you have an AUS console, select EUR
1. Edit the selected flipnote
1. Tap the frog icon on the bottom-left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select `Copy` -> `Back` -> `Exit`
1. Tap on the second note with a larger face, and select `Edit`
1. Tap on the frog icon on the bottom-left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select paste

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have `boot.nds` (which is dumpTool in this case) on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

If the dumpTool menu appears, continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.

::: tip

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand.html)
