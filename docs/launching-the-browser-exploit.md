# Launching the Exploit (stylehax)

We'll start by first launching our exploit. For the best Unlaunch-free experience, or if the DSi camera is broken to install Unlaunch, we recommend using an exploit called "stylehax" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the DSi Browser application handles webpages.


## Requirements

- Nintendo DSi Browser installed on your Nintendo DSi
    - If you do not have the DSi Browser, then use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit.html) instead


## Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the DSi Browser application
1. Touch the `Go to Page` button
    - The button will have a green `www` icon
1. Type `opera:about`, and touch `Go` to load the page
1. Touch the HOME icon
1. Touch the `Go to Page` button
1. Type `stylehax.net`, and touch `Go` to load the page

::: tip

The exploit should take 21 seconds to take effect. If it takes longer than 30 seconds, then reboot, and try again.

:::

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have `boot.nds` (which is dumpTool in this case) on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

If the dumpTool menu appears, continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.

::: tip

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand.html)
