- Your Nintendo DSi console with [Unlaunch](installing-unlaunch.html) installed

## Instructions
### Section I - SD card setup

1. Download the latest release of [GodMode9i](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/GodMode9i/releases)
1. Extract `GodMode9i.nds` from the GodMode9i archive and place it anywhere on your SD card

### Section II - Nintendo DSi instructions
1. Launch GodMode9i
1. Ensure the Game Card is inserted into the console
1. Select the "NDS GAMECARD" option in GodMode9i
1. Select what you want to dump
    - The "Trimmed" options for the ROM will dump a smaller file that can save SD card space, however they won't work for most patches such as ROM hacks
