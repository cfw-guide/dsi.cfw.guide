## What will this guide do to my system?

The main homebrew application this guide has you install is TWiLight Menu++, which is an upgrade/replacement to the Nintendo DSi Menu that allows running other homebrew applications, retail DS games, emulators for various older systems, and more.

Below are two guide paths, with a minor difference in what it entails.


### Installing Unlaunch via Memory Pit

Memory Pit is an exploit utilizing the DSi Camera, compatible with all firmware versions. Optionally, this exploit can be used to install Unlaunch, a bootcode exploit that allows full control of the console on boot.

As Memory Pit is somewhat limited in homebrew compatibility, it is recommended to install Unlaunch, instead of using Memory Pit standalone. As this is the easiest method to install Unlaunch, this will be the recommended path. However, there is a very minor risk of **bricking** your console when installing Unlaunch, so if this is a concern, see the alternate method below.

### Flipnote Lenny

Flipnote Lenny is an exploit utilizing the Flipnote Studio application.

This exploit is better suited for standalone usage, and recommended if you do not plan on installing Unlaunch (explained in the Memory Pit section on this page.)

You can always install Unlaunch later if you decide later on that you want it.
