title: Launching the Exploit
---

We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For most users, we recommend using an exploit called "Memory Pit" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the Nintendo DSi Camera application handles image metadata.

Launching the exploit will boot you into TWiLight Menu++, a homebrew application that acts as a replacement to the DSi Menu.

::: tip

If you don't plan on installing Unlaunch and have Flipnote Studio, it is recommended to use [Flipnote Lenny](launching-the-flipnote-exploit.html) instead. [Which is the best exploit?](faq.html#which-is-the-best-exploit)

### Section I - Checking your DSi Camera Version

1. Power on your console
1. Open Nintendo DSi Camera
   - If you are prompted to complete the camera tutorial, do so now
   - If the tutorial crashes as you try to complete it, your Nintendo DSi camera hardware is likely broken in some way and you will not be able to use Memory Pit. Please use an [alternate exploit](alternate-exploits.html)
1. Open the album using the large button on the right
1. Take note of whether you have a Facebook icon alongside the star, clubs, and heart, outlined in red here:

### Section II - Memory Pit

1. Download the correct Memory Pit binary for your Nintendo DSi Camera version:
   - [If you ***did*** have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin)
   - [If you did ***not*** have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
1. Navigate to the `sd:/private/ds/app/484E494A/` folder on your SD card
   - You will already have this directory if you have previously taken photos to your SD card via the Nintendo DSi Camera application. If so, you do not need to delete it and recreate it
   - If it does not exist, please create the individual folders
1. If there is already a `pit.bin` file in that path, create a backup of that file
1. Place the Memory Pit `pit.bin` file in this folder
1. If there's a folder named `DCIM` in the root of your SD card, make a back up of it so you don't lose the pictures inside, and then remove it from the SD card 


## Section III - Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Nintendo DSi Camera application
1. Select the SD Card icon in the top-right
   - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
   - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
1. Open the album using the large button on the right
   - The screen should flash magenta if Memory Pit was copied correctly

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have TWiLight Menu++'s `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

::: warning

If you enter the SD card camera album and nothing unusual happens, ensure that you downloaded the correct version of Memory Pit for your version and region, and placed it into the correct folder on your SD card. Also ensure that the `DCIM` folder does not exist on your SD card.

:::

You can now use TWiLight Menu++! First, it will ask you to select your language and region. These do not need to match your console's language or region so set them to whichever you prefer. Next it's recommended to continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.
