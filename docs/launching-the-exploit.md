# Launching the Exploit

We'll start by first setting up your SD card to launch our exploit. For most users, we recommend using an exploit called "Memory Pit" which takes advantage of a flaw in how the Nintendo DSi Camera application handles image metadata.

::: tip

If you don't plan on installing Unlaunch and have either the DSi Browser or Flipnote Studio, it is recommended to use either [stylehax](launching-the-browser-exploit.html) or [Flipnote Lenny](launching-the-flipnote-exploit.html) instead. [Which is the best exploit?](faq.html#which-is-the-best-exploit)

## Section I - Checking your DSi Camera Version

1. Power on your console
1. Open Nintendo DSi Camera
    - If you are prompted to complete the camera tutorial, do so now
    - If the tutorial crashes as you try to complete it, your Nintendo DSi camera hardware is likely broken in some way and you will not be able to use Memory Pit. Please use an [alternate exploit](alternate-exploits.html)
1. Open the album using the large button on the right
1. Take note of whether you have a Facebook icon alongside the star, clubs, and heart, outlined in red here:

## Section II - Memory Pit

1. Download the correct Memory Pit binary for your Nintendo DSi Camera version:
    - [If you ***did*** have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin)
    - [If you did ***not*** have a Facebook icon](/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin)
1. Navigate to `sd:/private/ds/app/484E494A/` on your SD card
    - `sd:` is the root of the SD card
    - You will already have these directories if you have previously taken photos to your SD card via the Nintendo DSi Camera application
    - If they (or just `484E494A`) do not exist, please insert the SD card into your DSi, launch the DSi Camera application, and then select the SD Card icon in the top-right for the folder(s) to be created
        - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
        - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
1. Inside the `484E494A` folder, rename the existing `pit.bin` file to `tip.bin`
1. Place the Memory Pit `pit.bin` file in the `484E494A` folder
1. If there's a folder named `DCIM` in the root of your SD card, make a back up of it so you don't lose the pictures inside, and then remove it from the SD card


## Section III - Launching the exploit

1. Ensure your SD card is inserted into your Nintendo DSi
1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the Nintendo DSi Camera application
1. Select the SD Card icon in the top-right
    - If you receive a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card
    - If you receive a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, ensure your SD card is [formatted correctly](sd-card-setup.html)
1. Open the album using the large button on the right
    - The screen should flash magenta if Memory Pit was copied correctly

::: warning

If you enter the SD card camera album and nothing unusual happens, ensure that you downloaded the correct version of Memory Pit for your version and region, and placed it into the correct folder on your SD card. Also ensure that the `DCIM` folder does not exist on your SD card.

:::

::: warning

If the top screen turns green, you do not have `boot.nds` (which is dumpTool in this case) on the root of your SD card. Follow the [prep work](get-started.html#section-i-prep-work) again.

:::

::: warning

Taking photos with the Memory Pit exploit on your SD card will cause the exploit to stop working properly and you will have to copy it over again.

:::

If the dumpTool menu appears, continue on and make a NAND backup. This can potentially be used to save your console if anything bad happens in the future.

::: tip

Continue to [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand.html)
