title: Alternate Exploits
---

If you are introduced to a tutorial when launching the Nintendo DSi Camera application and get a crash when attempting to complete it, you cannot use Memory Pit. Here, you may find alternate exploits that may work in lieu of Memory Pit.

::: tip

Ensure you have set up [TWiLight Menu++](launching-the-exploit.html#twilight-menu) on your SD card before proceeding.

:::

::: tip

Any of the alternate exploits should only be used as necessary. Try to use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit) when possible.

:::

::: tip

If you're on an older firmware, you may have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare(True_DSi-Mode)_Exploits).

These will not be covered here as they are largely obsolete. They should only be used as a last resort, if both Memory Pit and Flipnote Lenny aren't working for you.

petit-compwner will not be usable for the purpose of working around Memory Pit, as it requires a working camera to launch the exploit.
