Do not system update after installing hiyaCFW. This will remove hiyaCFW's SD patches.
{: .notice--danger}

hiyaCFW is a custom firmware that will allow you to run your system NAND (internal storage) off of your SD card.

This allows you to install your own apps to the Nintendo DSi Menu without risk of bricking, as they're installed to the SD card so problems can be easily be fixed.

It also features easy installation of homebrew applications to the DSi Menu, and displaying a custom splash screen on boot.

This section is entirely optional. If Unlaunch is enough for you, you can stop here.
{: .notice--primary}

## Requirements
- A Nintendo DSi with [Unlaunch](/installing-unlaunch) installed
- A NAND Backup taken from your device using dumpTool
   - If you don't have one of these, follow our [Dumping NAND](dumping-nand) guide
- A Windows, macOS or Linux device
