{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

If you are introduced to a tutorial when launching the Nintendo DSi Camera application and get a crash when attempting to complete it, you cannot use Memory Pit. Here are other exploits you could use instead

Ensure you have set up [TWiLight Menu++](launching-the-exploit#twilight-menu) on your SD card before proceeding
{: .notice-info}

Any of the below exploits should only be used as necessary. Try to use [Memory Pit](launching-the-exploit) when possible
{: .notice-info}

{% capture otherinstructions %}
If you're on an older firmware, you have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare(True_DSi-Mode)_Exploits).

These will not be covered here as they are largely obsolete. They should only be used as a last resort, if both Memory Pit and Flipnote Lenny aren't working for you.

petit-compwner will not be usable for the purpose of working around Memory Pit, as it requires a working camera to launch the exploit.

## Flipnote Lenny
### Requirements

- A copy of Flipnote Studio installed on your Nintendo DSi
   - If you do not have Flipnote Studio, there is no way to download it due to the closure of the Nintendo DSi Shop. Please use one of the legacy exploits above.
- The latest version of [Flipnote Lenny](https://davejmurphy.com/%CD%A1-%CD%9C%CA%96-%CD%A1/)

### Nintendo DSi - Instructions

1. Copy the `private` folder from the Flipnote Lenny archive to the root of your SD card
1. Insert your SD card into your Nintendo DSi and turn it on
1. Launch Flipnote Studio
1. Open the Flipnote settings and ensure that "Booting to Calendar" is disabled
1. View the flipnotes stored on the SD card
1. Tap on the face corresponding to your region
  - If you have an AUS console, select EUR
1. Edit the selected flipnote
1. Tap the frog icon in the bottom left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select `Copy` -> `Back` -> `Exit`
1. Tap on the second note with a larger face, and select "Edit"
1. Tap on the frog icon in the bottom left
1. Tap on the film roll icon
1. Select paste

If your Nintendo DSi flashes magenta but the top screen turns green while the bottom is white, then you do not have `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card.

You should now be looking at the Nintendo DSi Splash Screen, which is being handled by TWiLight Menu++.
