1. Go to the properties window of your SD card
   - `Windows Explorer` -> `This PC` -> Right click your SD card -> `Properties`
1. In the tools tab, Select `Check Now`
1. Check both `Automatically fix file system errors` and `Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors`
1. Start the checking process

This will scan the SD card and correct any errors it finds

## Section III - Checking SD card read/write

1. Download and extract [the h2testw archive](http://www.heise.de/ct/Redaktion/bo/downloads/h2testw_1.4.zip) anywhere on your computer.
   - It can also be extracted on an external device as long as that external device isn't your SD card
1. With your SD card inserted into your computer, run `h2testw.exe`
1. Select which language you'd like to see h2testw in
1. Set your SD card's drive letter as your target
1. Ensure `all available space` is selected
1. Click `Write + Verify`
- Wait until the process is completed

If the test shows the result `Test finished without errors`, your SD card is good and you can delete all `.h2w` files on your SD card
{: .notice--info}

If the test shows any other results, your SD card may be corrupted or damaged and you may have to replace it!

## Section I - Formatting your SD card
1. Make sure your SD card is **not** inserted into your Linux machine
1. Launch the Linux Terminal
1. Type `watch "lsblk"`
1. Insert your SD card into your Linux machine
1. Observe the output. It should match something like this:
```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0     179:0    0   3,8G  0 disk
└─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0   3,7G  0 part /run/media/user/FFFF-FFFF
```
1. Take note of the device mount point. In our example above, it was `mmcblk0p1`
   - If `RO` is set to 1, make sure the lock switch is not slid down
1. Hit CTRL + C to exit the menu
1. Type in `sudo mkdosfs /dev/(device mount point from above) -s 64 -F 32` to create a single FAT32 partition with 32 KB cluster size on the SD card

## Section II - Using F3
1. Download and extract [the F3 archive](https://github.com/AltraMayor/f3/archive/v7.2.zip) anywhere on your computer.
1. Launch the terminal in the F3 directory
1. Run `make` to compile F3
1. With your SD card inserted and mounted, run `./f3write <your sd card mount point>`
   - Wait until the process is complete. See below for an example output:
   ```
   $ ./f3write /media/michel/6135-3363/
   Free space: 29.71 GB
   Creating file 1.h2w ... OK!
   ...
   Creating file 30.h2w ... OK!
   Free space: 0.00 Byte
   Average Writing speed: 4.90 MB/s
   ```
1. Run `./f3read <your sd card mount point>`
- Wait until the process is complete. See below for an example output:
   ```
   $ ./f3read /media/michel/6135-3363/
                     SECTORS      ok/corrupted/changed/overwritten
   Validating file 1.h2w ... 2097152/        0/      0/      0
   ...
   Validating file 30.h2w ... 1491904/        0/      0/      0

      Data OK: 29.71 GB (62309312 sectors)
   Data LOST: 0.00 Byte (0 sectors)
               Corrupted: 0.00 Byte (0 sectors)
      Slightly changed: 0.00 Byte (0 sectors)
            Overwritten: 0.00 Byte (0 sectors)
   Average Reading speed: 9.42 MB/s
