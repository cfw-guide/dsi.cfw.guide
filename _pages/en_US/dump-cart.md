title: "Dumping Cartridges"
---

This is an add-on section for dumping cartridges using GodMode9i, useful for loading the cartridge on emulators, flashcarts or your SD card via nds-bootstrap. You also need this if you'd like to get into ROM hacking.

### What You Need

* Your Nintendo DSi console with your game cart inserted into your console and [Unlaunch](unlaunch) installed.
* The latest release of [GodMode9i](https://github.com/RocketRobz/godmode9i/releases/latest){:target="_blank"}

### Instructions

1. Extract `GodMode9i.nds` from the GodMode9i archive and place it anywhere on your SD card.
2. Launch GodMode9i via the Unlaunch menu.
  - Hold **(A)** & **(B)** to go to the Unlaunch menu.
3. Select the cartridge option in GodMode9i.
4. Select if you want the padding or not:
  - Full: Padding included
  - Trim: Padding removed

The dump will be found in `SD:/gm9i/out`.
