## What is homebrew?

Homebrew applications are unlicensed software made for closed systems such as the Nintendo DSi. This can include save editors, games, emulators and more.

Homebrew can be run for free on all Nintendo DSi consoles, regardless of firmware version or region.

## What can I do by modding my system?

- Redirect your NAND to the SD card
- Use normally incompatible flashcards
- Boot into different homebrew applications by holding different buttons when turning on your Nintendo DSi.
- Launch any DSiWare (out-of-region and/or 3DS exclusives) from your SD card.
- Run Nintendo DS game backups natively on your DSi SD card without the need of a flashcard.
- Watch your favorite movies using MPEG4Player.
- Run old-time classics using a variety of emulators.
- Emulate the DS Memory Pak for software that requires it
- Use FreeNAND to transfer configurations, sys, titles and tickets to another Nintendo DSi from a SD NAND
- Display an image (refered to as the boot splash) on system launch.

## What should I know before starting?

- Installing Unlaunch modifies your NAND, which could potentially (but rarely has) result in a brick.
  - While Unlaunch is optional, it does give the benefit of homebrew launching on boot amongst other things.
- Make sure your console is decently charged when following this process. A sudden power loss could result in serious damage.
- The recommended exploit is Memory Pit, which exploits a flaw in the Nintendo DSi Camera application. It is a pre-installed application so this exploit will work for all retail systems, regions and firmware versions.
  - However, if Memory Pit is unusable on your Nintendo DSi, there are other exploits available depending on which DSiWare software you have installed on your system.
- On Windows, it's recommended to [show file extentions](file-extensions-(windows)) if you are using the default File Explorer.

Get started by [Launching your Exploit](exploit-launch).
