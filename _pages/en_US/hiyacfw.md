Do not system update after installing hiyaCFW. This will remove hiyaCFW's SD patches.
{: .notice--danger}

hiyaCFW has several advantages that an Unlaunch-only system will not. These include:
- Redirecting your NAND to the SD card
- Installing homebrew applications to the System Menu with ease
- Display a custom splash screen on system boot

## Requirements
- A Nintendo DSi with [Unlaunch](unlaunch)
- A [NAND backup](nand-dump) taken from your device, with the NO$GBA Footer
  - dumpTool will create this footer automatically when it makes a backup
  - You could use the NAND dump created during the guide, or create one now at this point in time.
- The latest version of [hiyaCFW Helper](https://github.com/mondul/HiyaCFW-Helper/releases){:target="_blank"}
  - Windows users are recommended to use the compiled `.exe` binary + the latest version of [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html){:target="_blank"}
  - Users of other operating systems could use the source code file `.py` (requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} with the Tk library)

## Instructions
### Section I - Preparing your SD card
1. Extract the hiyaCFW Helper archive anywhere on your computer.
2. Launch hiyaCFW Helper.
 - If launching the `.py` file opens IDLE, open the terminal to this directory and type `py3 HiyaCFW_Helper.py`
 - Windows users can just double click the `.exe` file in Windows Explorer
3. Click the `...` button in the `NAND file with No$GBA footer` box.
4. Navigate to your NAND backup, and click `Open`.
5. Press `Start`.
6. In the new pop-up window, navigate to the root of your SD card, and press `OK`.
  - The process may take several minutes

When it says "Done", then you may eject your SD card and insert it into your Nintendo DSi.

### Section II - Configuring hiyaCFW on your system
1. Power on your Nintendo DSi console while holding **(A) + (B)**.
  - Unlaunch's GUI should appear.
2. Launch `hiyaCFW`.
  - You can launch hiyaCFW automatically when booting your console by [configuring your options](unlaunch#switching-button-booting-combination).
3. Change the settings to your liking, and press (START) to continue

Your system will now boot from the SD card instead of the internal NAND.

### Section III - "An Error Has Occurred"
If you receive this screen, it means you have too much free space on your SD card. The amount of free space compatible goes by every other range of two gigabytes. For example, 0-2 GB worth of free space works while 2-4 GB doesn't.

Enter the free space on your SD in the box below, press enter, and it will tell you if your SD has a working amount of free space. (Javascript required for it to work)

<input id="sdSpace" type="number" placeholder="Free space on your SD, in gigabytes (ex. 1.5)" oninput="updateWillWork()">
Your SD card<span id="willWork">...</span><noscript>is unable to be checked due to JavaScript being disabled. Please enable it in your web browser and try again.</noscript>

If your SD needs less free space, you can easily fill it with dummy files. Listed below are command prompt/terminal commands that will make 1GB worth of dummy files.
 - Windows: `fsutil file createnew dummy0 1073741824`
 - Linux/macOS: `dd if=/dev/zero of=dummy0 count=1024 bs=1048576`

Fill it up until the website says that it will work.

The reason this happens is due to the way the Nintendo DSi System Menu was made. It uses a signed 32-bit integer, which means once an overflow occurs, it will jump to a negative number of free space. This causes the Nintendo DSi System Menu to freak out, resulting in an "An error has occured" screen. This was never intended by the developers, since the NAND never exceeded 128 MB. However, by using hiyaCFW, the NAND space is now determined by an exterior factor (your SD card), which can vary in size, resulting in this od behavior.

<script>
function updateWillWork() {
  let freeSpace = document.getElementById("sdSpace").value;
  document.getElementById("willWork").innerHTML = " " + ((freeSpace % 4) < 2 ? "will work!" : "needs dummy files...");
}
</script>
