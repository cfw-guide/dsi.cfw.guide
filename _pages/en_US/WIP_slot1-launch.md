The Nintendo DSi has a Slot-1 cartridge slot, and the Nintendo DSi System Menu has a built in Slot-1 launcher. However, not only does it block out unlicensed cartridges but many alternative Slot-1 launchers have additional benefits. These include expanding the VRAM bus to 32-bit (making 32-bit read/writes faster), boosting the CPU to 133 MHz, enabling internal SD card access (for homebrew) alongside other advantages.

However, compatibility isn't always so spot-on and whether titles boot or not depend on which Slot-1 launcher you use.

You will need to have Unlaunch installed to use custom Slot-1 launchers.
