In order to run homebrew applications, you'll need to have an entry point. Through the entry point, we will be launching TWiLight Menu++, an open-source homebrew application that can act as a replacement to the Nintendo DSi System Menu. It provides a customizable unified interface for navigating your Nintendo DSi SD card to launch a variety of titles, including Nintendo DS and Gameboy Advance.

There are different entry points you can use, each with different way of accessing them. The entry point that we recommend is Memory Pit, a Nintendo DSi Camera exploit. It works across all system regions and firmware versions. However, using Memory Pit requires you to have access to the SD card Album on the Nintendo DSi Camera application. If you have a broken camera and are treated to a tutorial when launching the camera, Memory Pit would be unusable on your system. You could use another exploit, provided you have the respective application.

- [Flipnote Lenny](installing-unlaunch-legacy) is an exploit which takes advantage of a bug in Flipnote Studio (an application preinstalled on most Nintendo DSi systems).
- If you are on an older Nintendo DSi firmware, you have access to save game exploits for a select [list of games](https://dsibrew.org/wiki/DSi_exploits#DSiWare(True_DSi-Mode)_Exploits).
  - Petit Compwner will not work, as it requires you to scan QR codes. If you're able to scan the QR codes, you should be able to use Memory Pit.

## Section I - SD Card Setup
Make sure your SD card is [formatted correctly](faq#what-are-the-sd-card-requirements).
{: .notice--warning}

The source code is not needed. You only need the actual files.
{: .notice--info}

1. Download the version of Memory Pit corresponding to the version and region of your Nintendo DSi.
  - [for versions 1.0 - 1.3   (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin){:target="_blank"}
  - [for versions 1.4 - 1.4.5 (USA, EUR, AUS, JPN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/768_1024/pit.bin){:target="_blank"}
  - [for versions 1.0 - 1.4.6 (KOR, CHN)](https://github.com/emiyl/dsi.cfw.guide/raw/master/assets/files/memory_pit/256/pit.bin){:target="_blank"}

2. Place Memory Pit (`pit.bin`) in the `private/ds/app/484E494A` folder on your SD card.
   - You may create the folder if it doesn't exist.
3. Download the latest release of [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases/latest){:target="_blank"}
4. Copy the `boot.nds` file and the `_nds` folder from the `DSi&3DS - SD card users` folder to the root of your SD card
5. Copy *the contents of* the `SDNAND root` folder in the `DSi - CFW users` folder to the root of your SD card
6. Copy the `_nds` folder to the root of your SD card
  - Replace files and merge folders, if asked.

Yes, there are two `_nds` folders. While the first one contained all the TWiLight Menu++ files, those are universal to flashcarts as well. The second `_nds` folder contains DSi/3DS specific files, such as the homebrew version of nds-boostrap.

## Launching the exploit

1. Boot your Nintendo DSi and launch the DSi Camera application.
2. With your SD card inserted into your console, select the SD Card icon on the top right.
 - If you recieve a message saying your SD card isn't inserted, please use another SD card.
 - If you recieve a message saying that your SD card cannot be used, please make sure your SD card is [formatted correctly](faq#what-are-the-sd-card-requirements).
3. Select your SD card's camera album.
 - If you copied Memory Pit correctly, the system should flash magenta

If your SD card was properly setup, the top screen should now boot into TWiLight Menu++.

If your Nintendo DSi flashes magenta but the top screen turns green while the bottom is white, then you do not have `BOOT.NDS` on the root of your SD card.
